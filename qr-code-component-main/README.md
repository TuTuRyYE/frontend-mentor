## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla HTML & CSS
- ChatGPT for helping me

### What I learned

- Have learned to add custom fonts to a webpage
- I managed to get really close to the correct px for width and size

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

To center elements on a page
```css
html,
body {
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    align-items: center;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
}
```

To import font
```html
  <style>
    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit');
  </style>
```


### Continued development

This was IMHO the most simple thing we can do and it took me a long time...
I need to learn if using a lot of % for margin etc... is really good
